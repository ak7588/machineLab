# Did that work?

## Sweat, blood, tears, and many mistakes later
(joking... though mistakes are real!)

If there is anything IM coursework has taught me, it is that mistakes are OKAY and are a part of the journey. Sometimes they are also fun, if you work with friends.
Shout-out to @ Shreya and the IM Lab First Aid Kit, who made 2 hours in the lab on Friday night more bearable and saved my wrist from a glue gun burn.

Here are some close up pictures of the mechanism I've built, and let's talk about it in more detail below.

## Discussion

A list of mistakes and fixes made:
- Length of the crank + connecting rod. **Mistake:** Too short / too long. **Solution:** Should somehow be proportional to the distance and angle. This worked out rather intuitively, but there is for sure physics behind it.
- Placing the supporting table for the crank and rod. **Mistake:** Too close / too far.  **Solution:** Place it right at the end of the crank, so that it doesn't get stuck while rotating.
- Misplaced cam. **Mistake:** Didn't pay attention to the cam movement when making the crank. As a result, initial placement did not work for the mechanism. **Solution:** cut a new circle and glued it to the right location (shown in video 2).
- Slider going all over the place. **Solution:** glue cardboard "borders" for the slider path, almost like rails, for it to travel only back and forth, not left and right.

**Important Learnings**:
- Safety comes first! Be careful with hot objects and remember about the first aid kit in the lab.
- There is physics behind everything. If something isn't working, check physics.
- Friends make working fun.
- Mechanisms are doable and can be DIY'ed, though can take more time than expected.

**Next steps?**
- I would be interested to learn where these mechanisms are applicable next.
- How these are used in the real-world solutions?
