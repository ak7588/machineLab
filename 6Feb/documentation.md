## Sweat, blood, tears, and many mistakes later (joking...but mistakes are real!)

If there is anything IM coursework has taught me, it is that mistakes are OKAY and are a part of the journey. Sometimes they are also fun, if you work with friends.
Shout-out to @ Shreya and the IM Lab First Aid Kit, who made 2 hours in the lab on Friday night more bearable and saved my wrist from a glue gun burn.

Here are some close up pictures of the mechanism I've built, and let's talk about it in more detail below.
