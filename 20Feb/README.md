# First Clock Sketch

To describe my sketch in a few words, it consists of four major parts:

### 1. Clock Face

This looks fun and unexpected from a traditional clock face. Perhaps weirdly shaped arrows and numbers, non-circular face.

### 2. Wooden Body 

The body holding the clock could be made of wooden plates. The size and shape can be decided with class, maybe it can even be a shelf on the bottom and the clock on top.

### 3. Sound Mechanism

Every 15, 30, or 60 minutes something major could happen with the clock. I imagine some kind of zigzag mechanism (??) or sound-making mechanism. This is an alternative to the cookoo bird / hinge articulation mechanism? :)

### 4. Customizable neopixel

There can be a customizable neopixel attached to the clock device. It can be connected to the internet and accessible for the NYUAD community to customize once a day / every few minutes (?)
